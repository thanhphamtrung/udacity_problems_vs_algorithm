I have sorted the array first with descending order with quick sort (O(logn))

Then split the sorted list into a list to store the frequency of the number.
loop through the sorted list and distribute number in to 2 answer list sequentially. (O(n))

Time and Space Complexities:
- Time: O(logn) + O(n)
- Space: O(n)
