This problem is quite same with problem 5. I used Trie to store all the paths (children) that split by `/`.

For split method, I just apply what lecture teach me in this course. - Time complexity: O(n)
        - Space complexity: O(n)

For lookup method, I used find and split_path method with both O(n), so       - Time complexity analysis: O(n)
                    - Space complexity analysis: O(n)
